    <ul>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>User name</li>
    </ul>
    <Other>This information will be stored as soon as your account is created. Other information is collected through log files:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>Date of connection</li>
        <li>Visited page</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information will be used by the administrator in case of abuse.</p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>Several cookies will be created when you browse the platform.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A connection cookie when you are logged in</li>
        <li>A retention cookie when you check the <code>remember me</code> option when logging in</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The two cookies mentioned above are the only ones that are generated and used.</p>

    <h2>Publishing content</h2>
    <p>Information related to the content you post will be collected and stored. Text and images will be stored for later display.</p>
    <p>Only the author of an article and the administrator can make changes to an article.</p>
    <p>You also have the possibility to change the <code>visibility</code> of an article when editing. <code>Public</code> articles will be visible to everyone, while <code>private</code> articles will only be visible to the author.</p>

    <h2>Data storage time</h2>
    <p>As soon as your account is created, the data you enter will be stored indefinitely until your account is deleted due to abuse or a request from you. Also, the content you post will be stored indefinitely until it is deleted.</p>

    <h2>Data Protection</h2>
    <p>We have strict measures in place to protect your data.</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>For user security, we have implemented CSRF tokens to protect the forms. An SSL certificate has also been set up to protect exchanges between the user and the server. Finally, character string anonymisation algorithms (<i>hash</i>) are generated to anonymise data but also to prevent the decryption of this information.</p>
    <p>As for the server, we have set up an authentication system to restrict access to it. Other software such as a firewall has also been put in place.</p>

    <h3>Procedures in place</h3>
    <p>In accordance with the general regulations on data protection, in the event of a personal data leak, we will inform you of the nature of the data within a maximum of 72 hours after the data leak has been identified.</p>

legal.conduct.title: "Code of conduct"
legal.conduct.text: |
    <p>All persons registered or not on the <b>Needlify</b> platform are expected to follow the rules of good conduct. These rules apply to any individual or legal entity using this exchange and sharing platform.</p>
    <p>Due to the very identity of this platform, you will inevitably read articles with which you do not agree. If this is the case, do not get carried away. Stay calm, take time to think about it and come back a few minutes later.</p>
    <p>Needlify is above all a platform for exchange and sharing. You should therefore follow a few rules to keep this platform cool and pleasant. Here is a non-exhaustive list of behaviours that you <b>MUST NOT</b> adopt.</p>

    <h3>Share violent content</h3>
    <p>The content you share will be seen by anyone. Anyone means adults and young people alike can read the articles on this platform. Think about all the people who will be able to see your post and ask if the content is offensive and appropriate.</p>

    <h3>The topic of the articles</h3>
    <p>Obviously, the articles you write must relate to the theme of the platform. In other words, an article about fairy unicorns in the world of magic stars will, of course, not be accepted. On the other hand, you can deal with subjects concerning new technologies, development, programming, design, entrepreneurship, organization, management, ...</p>

    <h3>Insults/hate</h3>
    <p>First and foremost, please be aware that in many countries, laws exist to punish hate speech and defamation on the internet. We reserve the right to deal with hateful content and to remove such content when appropriate.</p>

    <h3>Harassment</h3>
    <p>Harassment in any form is not tolerated.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The publication of humiliating texts or images</li>
        <li>Bullying</li>
        <li>The publication of private messages</li>
        <li>Insults</li>
        <li>All other forms of harassment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All these forms of harassment will not be tolerated on this platform.</p>

    <h3>Inappropriate content for minors</h3>
    <p>Inappropriate or unsuitable content for minors will not be allowed. Violent or sexual content directed at or featuring minors is not permitted.</p>

    <h3>Discrimination</h3>
    <p>Discrimination, as well as harassment, will not be allowed.</p>

    <h3>Spam</h3>
    <p>The publication and sharing of similar content repeatedly is not allowed. Likewise, massive account creation will be sanctioned.</p>

    <h3>Use of bot and automation</h3>
    <p>The use of programs allowing the automation of actions such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The creation of an account</li>
        <li>The publication of content</li>
    </ul>
    <p>is not allowed.</p>

    <h3>Copyright</h3>
    <p>Respect for copyright is paramount. You must not use content for which you do not have the authorisation of the creator.</p>

    <h3>Impersonation</h3>
    <p>Impersonation or pretending to be someone else is not allowed.</p>

    <h3>Pornography</h3>
    <p>This platform is not intended to share pornographic content. Other platforms are designed for that.</p>

    <h3>Violation of privacy</h3>
    <p>Content that shares private or personally identifiable information without consent is not allowed. This includes the sharing of credentials, credit card numbers, social security numbers or any other personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h3>Phishing &amp; malicious content</h3>
    <p>The sharing of malicious and fraudulent content is not permitted. Similarly, sharing malicious code will not be allowed.</p>

    <h2>If you break any of these rules</h2>
    <p>Depending on the severity of the situation, we will first send you an email asking you to explain your actions. At the same time, your account will receive a warning. After two warnings, your account will be temporarily suspended. If you receive another warning after your account has been reinstated, your account will be deleted.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to delete content that is deemed inappropriate. We hope it doesn't come to that.</p>
